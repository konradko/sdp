When is it appropriate to use the Abstract Factory design pattern?

It is appropriate to use when creating a library of products where the system needs to be independent from the way products are created. A good example would be a UI framework, where common widgets (like text fields, windows, buttons etc.) can be encapsulated and decoupled from invidual platform implementation details.
