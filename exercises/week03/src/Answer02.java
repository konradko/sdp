/* a)
Question: every interface must have at least one method
Answer: false
 */

/* b)
Question: an interface can declare instance fields that an implementing class must also declare
Answer: false
 */
interface InvalidInterfaceWithInstanceFields {
    // Java interfaces cannot be instantiated, thus this would not compile:
    // int x;
    // All interface fields are automatically public, static, and final
}

/* c)
Question: although you canâ€™t instantiate an interface, an interface definition can declare constructor
methods that require an implementing class to provide constructors with given signatures.

Answer: false. A class can implement multiple interfaces and it is impossible to construct an object
that calls multiple constructors.
